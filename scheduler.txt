1. What are differences in how the jobs are managed between FCFS and FPPS?
	FCFS manages jobs by carrying them out in the 
	order they come in.  New jobs are put at the end 
	of the queue.  Then the scheduler will perform 
	the job at the front of the queue before moving 
	onto the next job.

	FPPS manages jobs by assigning each job a 
	priority.  Jobs are put into a queue, and the 
	highest priority jobs are put at the front of the 
	queue and carried out first, before the lower 
	priority jobs are carried out.  Each time a new 
	job is added, it will be sorted into the queue 
	according to its priority value.

2. What are the advantages of FCFS over FPPS and vice versa?
	The advantage that FCFS has over FPPS is that 
	they can be faster and less complex.  So for 
	certain schedulers that have jobs where priority 
	doesn't matter, it is a better implmentation for 
	that.

	The advantage of FPPS is that jobs of high 
	priority, which are more important, will be 
	carried out before low priority jobs are carried 
	out.  So for schedulers where priority matters, 
	FPPS is the better implmentation.

3. What potential problems do you see happening if you were using an operating system with an FCFS scheduler?
	If the operating system has a lot of high 
	priority jobs, there will be reduced performance, 
	since lower priority jobs may be performed 
	before the high priority ones.

4. What potential problems do you see happening if you were using an operating system with an FPPS scheduler?
	If the priority of the jobs isn't important for 
	this operating system, then it would also suffer 
	from reduced performance because of the 
	complexity of how the FPPS is implemented.
